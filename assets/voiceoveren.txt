Hi, Astral Expressers... Well, you caught me.
All space and time are practically infinite, and yet right here, right now, we find ourselves together. That's the nature of destiny - it creates a miracle but convinces you of an accident.
Oh, bye-bye. See if you can surprise me next time.
Before I joined the Stellaron Hunters, the nature of my work meant that I barely ever saw the same person twice.
Elio said that I'm good at creating "fear", even though I don't know what it is.
Playing the violin and firing a gun both require flexible fingers, but bullets are more obedient.
I especially love velvet coats, they're so fragile and beautiful. Difficult to maintain - you only have to be a tiny bit careless to ruin the sheen.
The past and the future are so similar to each other. I'm indifferent towards them.
There's a planet I go to every summer to look at the sea. That's when the tides are fiercest - you have to stand far away on the shore. Then, one year, they constructed a long observation pier. I haven't been back since.
My home world is one of many planets changed by a Stellaron... *sigh* It's a shame I never got to witness how far it fell at that time.
I like chatting with Silver Wolf. She's got a lot of ideas for someone so small.
Bladie... He takes after his name - his fights are a pleasure to witness.
Caught in the net.
Just in time.
May as well kill them all~
That breathing sensation? Remember it.
Time to move.
This won't take long.
Didn't hurt.
Not bad.
Good time never last.
Time to say bye. BOOM.
Relax.
Stand still.
This... isn't the end.
Oh! I'm still alive.
Thanks. You're too good to me.
Does that hurt?
The human body is beautiful in its fragility.
Hmm. We can use it.
Nice work.
Huh, they don't look happy to see us.
*sigh* Is that a stain? I like this coat.
